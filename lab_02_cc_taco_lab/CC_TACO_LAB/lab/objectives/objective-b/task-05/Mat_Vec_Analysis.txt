Bottleneck Analysis for Matrix-Vector Performance

(No Schedule) -

When comparing the generated file to the baseline file, we can see a pretty significant bottleneck in performance in three
areas: There are a good amount of overlapping loads and floating-point operations in specific ports, some ports are being
utilized in little to none amounts, and the critical path being taken through multiply-add operations is causing stalling.

To fix these bottlenecks, there are a few schedules we can run such as unrolling the loop to reduce index calculations
and loads, computing indexes before hand when accessing the matrixes and vectors, and expanding out the floating-point
operations to increase the throughput of the operation.
